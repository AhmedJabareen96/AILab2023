### Running the code

To run python code, use :

    python3.x ./LabX:\ Lab\ Name\ Here\ /main.py

replace 'x' with your current version of python. (3.8 or later is recommended)

replace 'X' with the number of lab folder. (1-4)

Please note that you might need to install some external python packages in order to run some script correcly.

In order to do so, use:

        pip3 install -r ./LabX/requirements.txt
    
Pip itself could be installed with:

        sudo apt update && \
        sudo apt install python3-pip
